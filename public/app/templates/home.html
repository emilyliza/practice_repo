			It takes businesses an average of two hours to respond to every chargeback. This includes the time to gather all of the data necessary to respond to chargeback. In other words, for every 20 chargebacks a merchant receives, the merchant is losing an entire week of an employee's time. However, with Chargeback.com's fully managed chargeback system, you can get that time back to spend on core business needs.</p>
		<p class="lead">
			Without the proper expertise, merchants win on average only 20% of all chargebacks they respond to. With the expertise provided by Chargeback.com, many of our clients experience a 200% - 300% increase in chargeback dispute success rates.
